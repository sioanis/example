# Quick Start

##### If you don't already have node and npm, the best way to install Node.js is to use one of the installers from [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/ "this link."). 

- Change directories into your project. 
	* e.g - ```cd ~/projects/example```
- You may need to run ```sudo``` if you are running into permission errors.
- Run ```npm install``` 
- Run ```gulp serve``` to preview and watch for changes
- Run ```gulp serve:test``` to run the tests in the browser
- Run ```gulp``` to build your webapp for production
- Run ```gulp serve:dist``` to preview the production build

*Local changes are located in app directory.*
